### Hi there! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56033661/129413109-17990938-5c37-4102-8447-219ad91bc5ba.gif" width="24px" alt="wave">


My name is [Dan Susman](https://dansusman.dev). I am a third-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, interested in backend and cloud development.

- ðŸ”­ I just finished an eight-month co-op at Corindus Vascular Robotics as a full-time software engineer. I worked on cloud integration and embedded application development using Python, the Qt framework, C++, Javascript, AWS, PostgresQL, Docker, and a bunch of other tech.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am using TypeScript, React, and GraphQL for my full-stack projects, and Golang for backend, networking, and distributed systems work. 
- ðŸ‘¯ I am a big fan of teamwork, pair programming, and open-source software. I'm hoping to be a bigger contributer to open-source communities in the near future ðŸ˜€.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my experiences in computer science, as a student, in a research lab, as a full-time software engineer, and anything else!
