### Hi there!

My name is [Dan Susman](https://dansusman.dev). I am a fourth-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I'm interested in backend, dev tools, privacy, programming languages, compilers, and developer experience. Getting into open-source contribution.... slowly but surely.
