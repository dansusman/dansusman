### Hi there! ![wave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56033661/129413109-17990938-5c37-4102-8447-219ad91bc5ba.gif | width=35)



My name is Dan Susman. I am a third-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, interested in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and learning new things.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working at Corindus, Inc. as a full-time software engineer co-op. I am working on cloud integration and embedded application development using Python, the Qt framework, C++, Javascript, AWS, PostgresQL, and Docker. Since Corindus is a robotic medical device company, we Corindus engineers aim for modularity, extensibility, tracibility, and extreme safety of code and documentation.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am using TypeScript, React, and GraphQL for my full-stack side projects. I am excited to be exploring Astro as I build my portfolio site. I believe Astro will be the future of frontend frameworks. Check it out [here](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro).
- ðŸ‘¯ I am a big fan of teamwork, pair programming, and other forms of collaboration. In my experience as a student and software engineer, these are some of the most integral parts of building successful products efficiently!
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my experiences in computer science, as a student, in a research lab, as a full-time software engineer, and anything else!
