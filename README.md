### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Dan Susman, as my GitHub username suggests ğŸ˜›. I am a second-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, interested in algorithm design, software development, alternative energies, and sustainability.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Corindus, Inc. as a software engineer co-op. I am learning the ins and outs of proper and safe software development for medical devices, using Python.
- ğŸŒ± Currently, I am learning C++ and googleTest for developing and testing robotic devices, and TypeScript and React for front-end endeavors.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. I love a challenge, and I love to learn!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my experiences in computer science, as a student, in a research lab, as a full-time software engineer, and anything else!
