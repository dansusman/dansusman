### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dan Susman. I am a third-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, interested in algorithm design, full-stack development, cloud technologies, and learning.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working at Corindus, Inc. as a software engineer co-op. I am learning the ins and outs of proper and safe software development for medical robotic devices, using Python, the Qt framework, C++, Javascript, AWS, PostgresQL, as well as various Project Management and Software Lifecycle Management platforms/services.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am using TypeScript and React for my full-stack side projects. I have been pulled in by the magnetism of web development recently, so I am excited to be exploring popular design patterns, and introducing myself to emerging and existing frameworks, tools, and languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am a big fan of teamwork, pair programming, and other forms of collaboration. In my experience as a student and software engineer, these are some of the most integral parts of building successful products!
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my experiences in computer science, as a student, in a research lab, as a full-time software engineer, and anything else!
- ðŸ˜€ Pronouns: He/Him/His
