### Hi there! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56033661/129413109-17990938-5c37-4102-8447-219ad91bc5ba.gif" width="24px" alt="wave">


My name is Dan Susman. I am a third-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, interested in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and learning new things.

- ðŸ”­ I just finsihed an eight-month co-op at Corindus Vascular Robotics as a full-time software engineer. I worked on cloud integration and embedded application development using Python, the Qt framework, C++, Javascript, AWS, PostgresQL, Docker, and a bunch of other tech.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am using TypeScript, React, and GraphQL for my full-stack side projects, but plan to explore Golang for backend work. I am excited to be using Astro.JS as I build my portfolio site. It's cool to be part of such an early community! Check it out [here](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro).
- ðŸ‘¯ I am a big fan of teamwork, pair programming, and open-source software. I'm hoping to be a bigger contributer to open-source communities in the near future ðŸ˜€.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my experiences in computer science, as a student, in a research lab, as a full-time software engineer, and anything else!
