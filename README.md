### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dan Susman. I am a third-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, interested in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and learning new things.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working at Corindus, Inc. as a software engineer co-op. I am working on embedded application and cloud development using Python, the Qt framework, C++, Javascript, AWS, PostgresQL, etc.. At Corindus, we focus on modularity, extensibility, tracibility, and safety of code and documentation.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am using TypeScript and React for my full-stack side projects. I am excited to be exploring Astro, which I believe will be the future of frontend frameworks.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am a big fan of teamwork, pair programming, and other forms of collaboration. In my experience as a student and software engineer, these are some of the most integral parts of building successful products efficiently!
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my experiences in computer science, as a student, in a research lab, as a full-time software engineer, and anything else!
- ðŸ˜€ Pronouns: He/Him/His
